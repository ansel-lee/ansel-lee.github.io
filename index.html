							<h6>My portfolio</h6>
							<p>
								After being started in a random computing lesson on a Wednesday,
								before recess,
								Kevin Langner and I have worked on this site, (Kevin learnt HTML
								just to help me with this :D)
								This is the first time I experimaent with transitions, and
								do a proper write-up for all my projects.

								This project was originally built for the ACSBR Science
								Department to inform students of their shifts, with refernce
								to their name. Over the years, I have added Sign In With Google
								and password hashing. With the introduction of AllEars by MOE, this
								project
								sadly only was used once in 2023.

								My first big web development project! Written in 2021,
								I created a one-stop shop for all reminders to my classmates
								listing, all the homework, announcements and even a (hardcoded)
								timetable for my class to refer to there. <br />
								This is where I learnt that the Github + Google Apps Script + Google
								Sheets "stack" can run my site for free!

							<h6>Leading Robotics CCA VIA</h6>
							<p>
								Being the in-charge for my CCA's VIA, I planned and taught 12
								(unrelated) students basic Spike Prime at MacPherson CC.
								Despite the percieved difficulty teaching advanced concepts such as
								line tracing without having them zone out, we pressed on and had a
								fulfilling time!

								<span class="morebutton nodisp">More...</span>

									Curriculum and slides were planned by me (hence the big comic sans)
									and edited by Daniel. CCA Teachers were impressed,
									and we managed to engage the learners throughout.

							<h6>Booklist Project</h6>
							<p>
								My last coding project for my school, and my most complicated one yet.
								Written at the end of 2023, this booklist listing system is specfically
								programmed to accomodate three different systems. Namely, PG1, 2, 3
								(Sec 1),
								Lower Secondary Express, N(A), N(T) (Sec 2) and Upper Secondary Subject
								Combinations (Sec 3 and Sec 4).
								<span class="morebutton nodisp">More...</span>
								<span class="more"><br />It doesn't show the price as my IT department
									did not want to look like being biased to Pacific Bookstores, and from
									this project I learnt that in the future I should use td and tr
									instead of CSS Grid, as
									merging cells are a pain (if you're curious, you can see the
									mathematics in the JavaScript file in the Repository).</span>

								I enjoy programming, and thinking of how to solve problems. I find a
								little bit of troubleshooting entertaining, just that it takes
								a little too much of my study time.

								Other than coding software, I also enjoy building and coding robots.
								Having done a little of NXT, EV3, EV3 Classroom and now Spike Prime,
								oh how times have changed!
								In 2019, I represented Singapore at the World Robot Olympiad in
								Hungary. I feel that Robotics is more troubleshooting, keeping
								your cool, lifting weights (computer and robots) and running back and
								forth between playfields and workstations.
								In my freetime during the pandemic, I built a lego lift (destroyed
								by my little sister).

								I LOVE playing Cities: Skylines.
								The splash/cover image for this site is Attractive District station.
								Fixing traffic and optimising train interchanges are my favourite
								activities. However, if more people take the trains, the roads will be 
								less congested and there is less to fix :p.<br />
								By the way, here's another of my city's cross-platform
								train interchanges, aptly named Interchange Park (ES4/DX7).<br />

								I started on video editing last year. Currently, I

								tunes recorded on my piano to

										drop duplicate frames.
									</a><br />
									I've recorded multiple videos, such as truck journeys on highway
									viaducts and traffic on interchanges, but only fully edited
									some. Of those, only a handful are published, as districts
									and roads are usually named after my friends.

						+<i>Some</i>  communication skills (monitor for 3 years; VIA IC in my CCA)<br /><br />
						For typed code (C++, Web Development), I use VSCode on Windows<br />
						For server side operations, I run Google Apps Script that calls a Google Sheet database 
						(with formulas to simplify code). This lets me run code for free (can see Querysystem
						for details). The HTML will usually be sent as a file, hosted Github Pages or
						embedded on Google Sites (easier for teachers to control access to data)<br /><br />
						I've participated in Hack@AC, Sibberrsec, and will attend YCEP for exposure to 
						cybersecurity
