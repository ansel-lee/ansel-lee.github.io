        <article>
            <a name="intro"><h2>1. Introduction and accepting the terms</h2></a>
            <p>
                Welcome to my site and stuff!&nbsp;<br /><br />
                I thought I would do a terms of service not only for fun, 
                but also to limit liability, learn in the process, 
                and include a privacy policy in case I need it for verification of my google cloud sign-in project.
                <br /><br />So let&rsquo;s get started being more formal<br /><br />
                Erm.. idk how tho&hellip;<br /><br />
            </p>
            <h5>Definition(s):</h5>
            <p>
                "Email": <a href="mailto:ansellee@googlegroups.com">ansellee@goooglegroups.com</a>
                <br />"I": Ansel Lee, the creator of this site.<br />
                <br />
                "Github": The service that I am hosting some of my sites on (for free, thanks Github!).
                <br /><br />
                "Google": The service that I am using for backend, to authenticate users, and for my email.
                <br />Like Github, Google did all these for me without me paying a single cent on my side 
                (I am fine with small ads). Thanks Google!
            </p>
            <h5>Updating terms</h5>
            <p>
                I reserve the right to update these terms from time to time, 
                whether fixing typos, grammatical errors <span aria-hidden="true">(yes I make errors, I am only a one-man team)</span>, 
                adjusting tone as I learn more English, or, on a more serious note, 
                complying with whatever I am obliged to. 
                I also will update these terms to include more of my projects, 
                so that I can prevent people claiming that I have no privacy policy or whatever nonsense.
            </p>
            <h5>terms</h5>
            <p>
                By using my site, you do not need to be of a specific age, 
                but at least have your parents consent to use the device if you are still under 15 or so.
                As long as you know basic English, have not run out of computer time, and will abide by these
                terms of service I think it will be fine. 
                If you have found any vulgarities or inappropriate content, 
                please do not hesitate to email me.
            </p>
            <h5>Legal stuff</h5>
            <p>
                These terms of service are not meant for the sole purpose of being a legal agreement, 
                but may be used in the unlikely case that I get sued or there is a legal case involving my site.
                &nbsp;
            </p>
            <a name="terms-3rdparty"><h5>Third party services I use</h5></a>
            <p>
                I use Github Pages to host some of my sites. These sites are easily distinguishable
                by the URL. By continuing to use and view my site on those pages, 
                you agree to <a href="github.com/tos">Github's terms of service</a>.
                <br /><br />
                I also use Google for my backend for my forms, for authentication of form submitters,
                Google script coding services for those who requested and Google forms to collect some of my responses too.
                Here's the <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US">Google terms of service</a>.
                By submitting forms, logging in with Google, and using the Google Apps Script scripts that I have coded,
                you agree to Google's terms of service.
                <br />
                Note: Some of the terms are service-specific (I think I am included under "Integrated services"),
                but there should be more, so please read carefully!

                By visiting my site, you agree to not twist my words, 
                or do anything you know you will be ashamed of later on. 
                Please do not do anything with a bad intention. It is just not nice.
                Do practise respect even though you may be hiding behind a digital mask, and please do not
                impersonate others.
                <br />
                Please also do not DDOS attack my site, although it is not my infrastructure.

                By logging in to submit a form, 
                you agree to not enter any vulgarities or post anything inappropriate,

                If you are hacking to see what my site can improve on, sure! Go ahead. 
                However, please do it ethically. 
                Once you believe you have found a bug, please contact me immediately and, 
                although it seems tempting to show off, 
                try not to post it anywhere else. 
                I might find a way to credit you later on if it is a genuine bug, 
                and reply if it was intended or I could not find out what was the bug.
        
                <br /><br />
                Please do not inject any malware into my site, and do inform me if there are any loopholes.

                If you have submitted something confidential (i.e. I/C number, passwords etc&hellip;), 
                or something you did not mean to send, you may request for them to be removed.
                But remember! Always think twice before you submit, or even better, think thrice (in chinese: 三思而行)!
                Do note that whatever that goes on to the web cannot be erased, who knows whether malware was 
                secretly installed into your computer to catch any bad thing you do?
                <br /><br />
                nah jk, but just please, do not submit anything private or inappropriate

                By submitting images, you agree that I might use the image for purposes related to my site, 
                also indicating that it is a form response.

                in whole or in part, liable for any damage caused whether mentally, or emotionally 
                arising from other user generated content (whether inserted through forms or hacking).

                <br /><br />
                I will try to remedy or take down any site once it has been made known to me that it is compromised.

            <p>
                I try to collect as little information as possible. 
                However, the third party services that I use (remember that I only use free services) 
                may also collect some info either for targeted advertising (money and server space do not grow on trees.
                and without tracking the advertisements shown to you might appear irritating), 
                diagnostics, security etc...

            <h4>i. Google login</h4>
            <p>
                I use google authentication in my web app so that I can identify who submitted my form, 
                as the web is a big space and there are many people, some with malicious intents, 
                who can view my site. 
                The only information that I request at this step is your email, name and profile picture.
                <br /><br />
                The token from the sign in is then sent to my backend, 
                which is a google apps script project which will generate a long key string that 
                I will use for your identification later on. 
                This key will tell me which column inside my google sheet will be used to record your answer. 
                I use a key instead of a column name to prevent users with malicious intent impersonating someone, 
                entering information that will shame that person, and then there will be a big problem.&nbsp;
            </p>
        
            <h4>ii. On question submit</h4>
            <p>
                Every time you submit a question, I will record your browser version and device, 
                and cross-check it with the information already inside the sheet. 
                my app will alert you should someone on another device try to send a request to the server with your key. 
                Unless you have some superpower ability to be able to transfer the key 
                (there is no text field to input the key inside the form), 
                you should pick the option of creating a new key.
            </p>

                I think almost nothing except the form data is collected. Just a reminder to not post anything
                that is private or inappropriate.

                *** only applies to people I know IRL
                My google apps script systems try to only collect what is required. 
                I will lay out the privacy policy and the information that the script collects when I work on the project
                with the person, as the information collected differs a lot per project.
